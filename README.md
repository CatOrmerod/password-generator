Homework Assignment 03 - Password Generator

## Motivation

Many websites and applications require a password that fufils multiple criteria. This password generator can take into account those criteria and come up with a unique random password every time.    

## Features of the Password Generator

```
On the click of the Generate Password button a series of prompts appears:
    * Number between 8-128
    * Uppercase characters to be included
    * Lowercase characters to be included
    * Special characters to be included
    * Numbers characters to be included
Alerts are then triggered based on the actions:
    * If a number between 8-128 is not entered the prompts will continue to run until an appropriate number is selected
    * If no criteria are selected an alert will appear and then return to the start of the criteria
Once the selections have been made a random password from that is shown in the textbox

```
